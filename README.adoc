== FAQ

=== Why the name?

*cct* (container configuration tool) was the name of a precursor tool to *concreate*. This module bundle was originally created for use with *cct* but has outlived it.

=== Temporary?

We are in the process of refactoring the modules. The end-goal is likely to be splitting this repository up into separate modules aligned by product.
